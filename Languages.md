# Languages

## Types of Languages

### Procedural

- Specify a series of well structured steps and process to compose a program
- Contains a systematic order of statement, functions, and commands to complete a task

### Functional

- Writing a program only in pure functions (never modify variables but only creates new ones as an output)
- Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data like ML.
- First class functions

### Object Oriented

- revolves around objects
- code + data = Object
- Developed to make it easier to develop, code, debug, reuse and maintain software.

# Static vs Dynamic Languages

**Static**

- Perform type checking at compile time --> int a = 10
- Errorrs will show at compile time
- declare data types before you use it
- more control

**Dynamic**

- Perform type checking at run time --> a = 10
- Errors might not show till program is run
- No need to declare datatype of that variable
- saves time in writing code but might get error at run time.
